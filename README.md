# dem-bs-server

WIP

# About done

- Basic web server example using [Opium](https://github.com/rgrinberg/opium) built with ReasonML.
- Dockerization

# Dev

## locally (with esy installed)

```
esy
esy dev
```

```
esy
esy start
```

 ## using docker (unexpectedly extremely slow !)

 ```
 make dev.image
 make dev
 ```

```
make image
make up
```
